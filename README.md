# Exasol CloudWatch Example Dashboard

This project contains an [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) template for an example CouldWatch dashboard that visualizes the metrics reported by the [Exasol â€“ Cloud Watch adapter](https://github.com/exasol/cloudwatch-adapter).

This dashboard should get you started with Exasol and CloudWatch integration.

## Quick Usage

If you just want to use the example dashboard, you can simply download the latest AWS CloudFormation template in the [releases section](https://github.com/exasol/cloudwatch-dashboard-examples/releases/) and run it in cloudformation.

There you will have to set a Deployment Name. This is the name of your exasol installation you entered during the setup of the cloudwatch-adapter.

## Advanced Usage

In this repository we define the dashboard by code using [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). That allows us to define the dashboard in a very readable way.

You can use this as a starting point for your own dashboards. For that you need to go through the following steps:

* Checkout (or fork) this repository
* Adapt the dashboard to your needs (modify `src/main/java/com/exasol/cloudwatchexampledashboard/CloudwatchDashboardExamplesStack.java`)
* [Install the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)
* Deploy your dashboard using
    ```shell
     cdk deploy --parameters deploymentName=<YOUR DEPLOYMENT NAME>
    ```
  (Don't forget to replace `<YOUR DEPLOYMENT NAME>` with the value you configured during the CloudWatch-adapter setup)
